## Hi there 👋
My name is Giulio and I am a student at ETH Zürich, where I study Robotics, Systems and Control. My passion for robotics started with Wall-E with a sprinkling of Ironman. My main interest lies with robots in uncertain situation and their interaction with humans.  
#
🔭 I’m currently working on integrating assessments of quality of movement into an exoskeleton used for post-stroke rehabilitation of the upper extremities (unfortunately the code in not public 🙃).  
🔭 Last semester me and some friends worked on porting and improving a framework for camera localization to Python/Pytorch for our 3D Vision course. You can find that here: https://github.com/Lippolis96/dsac_plusplus.
