## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Giulio and I am a student in the Robotics, Systems and Control Master of Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich.  
My main interests are computer vision and Human Robot Interaction.  
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on integrating assessments of quality of movement into an exoscheleton used for post-stroke rehabilitation of the upper extremities (unfortunately the code in not public ðŸ™ƒ).  
ðŸ”­ Last semester me and some friends worked on porting and improving a framework for camera localization to Python/Pytorch for our 3D Vision course. You can find that here: https://github.com/Lippolis96/dsac_plusplus.  
ðŸ’¬ If you want to know more about me, my cv is at https://giuschio.github.io/online-cv/.
